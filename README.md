# Getting started 
Clone the repo. Upload to your IDE of choice (I used VSCode). 

Install dependents
* [npm install](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

Run Locally
* Go to your terminal and use command: node index.js

It should be running on your localhost:3000 port. 

Once the program is running, you can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test, or copy and paste the URL: http://localhost:3000/closest-location?lat=38.099728&long=-93.578568 directly into your browser of choice. 

Change the lat and long values (within the URL or in Postman) in order to test different scenarios.
