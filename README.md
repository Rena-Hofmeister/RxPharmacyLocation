# Getting started 
Clone the index.js file. Upload to your IDE of choice (I used VSCode). 

Run the program. It should be running on your localhost:3000 port. 

Once the program is running, you can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test, or copy and paste the URL: http://localhost:3000/closest-location?lat=38.099728&long=-93.578568 directly into your browser of choice. 

Change the lat and long values (within the URL or in Postman) in order to test different scenarios.
